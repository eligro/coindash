CH Dear CoinDash contributors,

It is unfortunate for us to announce that we have suffered a hacking attack during our Token Sale event, during the attack $7Mil were stolen by a currently unknown perpetrator.
CoinDash project was able to secure $6.4Mil from our early contributors and whitelist participants and we are grateful for your support and contribution.

Coindash team always is responsible for all investors.
No matter which address you sent your ETH to contribute, you are all recognized as our investor. And we will distribute CDT tokens according to the original exchange rate.

Reminder again: Weâ€™re being hacked. Please do not send any ETH to any address anymore.
