Dear CoinDash contributors,

It is unfortunate for us to announce that we have suffered a hacking attack during our Token Sale event. During the attack $7 Million were stolen by a currently unknown perpetrator.
The CoinDash Token Sale secured $6.4 Million from our early contributors and whitelist participants and we are grateful for your support and contribution.

CoinDash is responsible to all of its contributors and will send CDTs reflective of each contribution. Contributors that sent ETH to the fraudulent Ethereum address, which was maliciously placed on our website, and sent ETH to the CoinDash.io official address will receive their CDT tokens accordingly. Transactions sent to any
 fraudulent address after our website was shut down will not be compensated.

This was a damaging event to both our contributors and our company but it is surely not the end of our project. We are looking into the security breach and will update you all as soon as possible about the findings.

The CoinDash vision, product and team will continue to live on. We will be fast to recover and we will create the future of trading.

Reminder: We are still under attack. Please do not send any ETH to any address, as the Token Sale has been terminated.

More information will be published on our social channels and our website.

- CoinDash Team
